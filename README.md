CI/CD Repository for Caterpillar Interview

These are the basic files that I used to create my Python Web Application that I'm running on Microsoft Azure. I'm utilizing their CI/CD DevOps tools as well.

Included are the:
  -app.yaml
  -requirements.txt
  -main.py
  
This python application was tested on a windows machine utilizing the Flask web framework. A virtual environment needs to be created to be able to run the application on the local machine.
